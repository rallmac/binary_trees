In this Project we are treating Binary trees. Binary trees is a concept of lists. But this time, the root node has two nodes called the child node. the node is one on the left and one on the right. and each child node also have their own child node. Any node that have other nodes is called the parent node.

A binary node is a node with at most two nodes. one on the left and the other on the right
